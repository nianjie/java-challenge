#### Restrictions
- use java 8


#### My experience in Java
- I have 15+ years experience in Java.
- I started to use Spring Boot from 2019, 
  and before that I had used other DI container which experience made my switch to Spring Boot easier.


#### What I want to do if having more time
- upgrade /api/v1 to /api/v2 with Spring HATEOAS to provide a RESTful service.
- add security to protect service.
- containerize, and adapt a microservice architecture.
